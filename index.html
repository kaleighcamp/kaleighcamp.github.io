<p>A 24 year old student who is trying to create originality and authenticity in this space we call " The Internet. " I think content creators have created a void on the internet that is filled with artificial and unauthentic content that makes others feel less than or lacking in certain ways. I want to fill that void with content that is creative and inspiring without leaving you feeling like things are unachievable.
